CURRICULUM FORMAT

At the end of the day, you cannot multitask. Therefore there is a logical chronological order for viewing each video to learn new ideas and practices.

CURRICULUM AUDIENCE

If you are in grade school, high school, or college and your school does not offer information security courses, this will help you to not waste time looking for quality material and worrying about material overlaps.

If you do not go to school, the same applies.

CURRICULUM DESIGN

Software is at the heart of information security. To understand how software works, we will start with the most primitive programming language: assembly. Assembly will allow us to see how software is constructed at a fundamental level. From there we will be able to disassemble other programs and learn from how they are constructed. This act of dissassembly to understand software better is called reverse engineering. Once we become good reverse engineers, we will be able to approach most information security problems through a scientific approach. That is to say that we can see how any piece of software is using the CPU and memory while running.

After reverse engineering, we will look at software development utilizing what we have learned from reverse engineering software. We will develop networking programs to understand TCP/IP and secure software development principles. These security principles include compiler added security checks and debugging tools. We will also develop a primitive web browser (aka interpreter) to handle selected HTML and javascript to understand web development, software development, and OSI model and TCP/IP further.

Once we understand software development, we will move into vulnerability discovery and exploit development. Using what we know about writing secure software, we will learn how to manually analyze source code for vulnerabilities and create fuzzers. We will learn about local and remote debuggers and exploitability analysis tools in order to determine if crashes are exploitable vulnerabilities. Finally, we will learn exploit development techniques starting with no memory protections and work up to current exploits that bypass the latest memory protections.

Now that we understand how software is built, let us familiarize ourselves with how it is used. As Windows is the most popular commercial operating system, we will look at how Windows domains are built and administrated.

Upon understanding how networks are design and administrated, we will take a look at penetration testing techniques to discover and exploit vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in computers and networking devices. We will then look at the best ways to expand network access through targeted information harvesting and exploitation.

Next, we will look at social engineering techniques. We will look at how to use the social engineering toolkit and the psychology behind why these attacks are so effective. We will also take a look at Kevin Mitnick's stories.

NOTE

This is subject to change. Windows internals, drivers, kernel debugging and exploitation will be added to the mix at some point. How do you think this should be done? Reach out on twitter @V1R3. Thank you.
